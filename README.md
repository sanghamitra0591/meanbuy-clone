MeanBuy.in is a Revolutionary eCommerce Market Place Initiative for community of Indian Business and making the benefits multiply and reach to direct 
beneficiaries stake holders. To bring nationwide artisans who are under privileged and don t have means to reach to online platform.

Being Technocrats and understood the market potential of dieing skills or handicrafts of tribes or smaller villages like handmade paintings, 
organic color painted clothing, coir work, shell work, bamboo handicrafts, home decorative, house hold items, organic gift packing material, 
bio degradable products made of paper mace by small tribal women especially from cities or villages or qasba which are under developed and don't 
have basic necessities and they are only based either to visit cities and send in weekly bazaar or they are selling to shops or merchants who earn 
good benefit and gives hardly any amount which are not sufficient enough to run the livelihood of artists/ small manufacturers.
